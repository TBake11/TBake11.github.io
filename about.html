    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        Currently, I am a junior at the University of Oklahoma studying Management Information Systems.
        Born in Dallas, Texas and raised in Allen, Texas, I have always seen myself to display a hardworking ethic.
        Being Involved with sports, my whole life has helped me devolop these characteristics along with hanlding
        responsibility and discipline. I hope to carry these characteristics in to the career field for the company that chooses
        to let me be apart of their community. As of now, I do not know what specifically that I want to do with an MIS degree, but I
        have considered Cyber Security, Data Analytics, and Software Devolopment. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and any kind of
        sporting activity with my friends. I have always enjoyed discovering new things like traveling the world, `along with being adventourous throughtout life.
